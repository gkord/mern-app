Working with MERN stack to build CRUD application

Building off of FreeCodeCamp's MERN Stack tutorial, this is an Exercise Tracker that allows the user to create a username, create an exercise log under existing username and edit/delete logs.

MongoDB is handling all the data on the back end with Express handling the routing.

I used the tutorial as inspiration but chose to deviate in the following ways:

- Coded entirely using React Hooks
- Chose to forgo css bootstrap in favour of styled-bootstrap-components (decided to to use a styling framework as design is not the purpose of this project)
- Added ability to Cancel when editing an exercise
